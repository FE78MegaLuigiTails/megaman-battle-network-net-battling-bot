This is the JSON code of my bot Megaman Battle Network Net Battling Bot.

How the bot works:
The bot generates random net battles every 30 minutes. Here are the rates of each type of net battle. “Deletion & net battling right now” scenarios are at the same rate as this one. Now the bot posts special net battles with stipulations (ex. Team Battles)

Prompt rates:

Regular Net Battles: 95%

Special Net Battles: 5%


Net Battling Rates:

1vs1: 50% (Common)

2vs2: 25% (Uncommon)

1vs2 (NetNavi vs Character): 13% (Rare)

1vs2 (Character vs NetNavi): 6% (Epic)

1vs3 (NetNavi vs Character): 3% (Legendary)

1vs3 (Character vs NetNavi): 2% (Mythical)
